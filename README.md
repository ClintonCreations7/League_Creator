For this project I made use of Pyton for the functionalities of the application plus Pyweb-IO to convert the the program
into a web application with a clean UI.
The user once they start the app they will be bale to create a League by entering the name of it, numbers of teams and
also the names of each of the teams within the league.
Once the league is created the user can view the upcoming fixtures and input the results, also view the leaderboard that
gets updated everytime a new result is entered.
Validations and Conditions are placed within the code to make sure that the Leaderboard updates properly by providing
for example the correct points, Goals scored and conceded...
